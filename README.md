# Binance-Bot

An algorithmic trading bot designed to run on Binance cryptocurrency exchange. It uses the Wave Trend concept, which is a more complex mathematical derivative of the simpler Moving Averages concept.

In the included paramters file, ETHBTC pair is run as an example. Other values are suggestions.

There is an included backtest function for deriving optimal paramters given the previous 3 days conditions and a trading pair. 

Wave Trend math is based on the work of LazyBear on TradingView and is not my invention.
